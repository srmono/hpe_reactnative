Typical directory structure for an Expo app created using `create-expo-app`:


# Directory Structure of an Expo App

When you create an Expo app using `create-expo-app`, the directory structure will look something like this:

## Root Directory

```
MyExpoApp/
├── assets/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── icon.png
│   └── splash.png
├── node_modules/
├── .expo/
│   ├── packager-info.json
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── App.js
├── app.json
├── babel.config.js
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock (or package-lock.json)
```

### Description of Key Files and Folders

#### `assets/`
- This folder is used to store static assets like images, fonts, and other resources.
- Common subdirectories:
  - `fonts/`: Store custom fonts here.
  - Other files like `icon.png` and `splash.png` for the app's icon and splash screen.

#### `node_modules/`
- Contains all the dependencies and packages installed via npm or yarn.

#### `.expo/`
- Contains Expo-specific settings and configurations.
- You typically don't need to manually modify files in this folder.

#### `.gitignore`
- Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by version control (git).

#### `App.js`
- The main entry point of the application.
- This is where the root component of the app is defined.

#### `app.json`
- Configuration file for the Expo project.
- Includes settings such as app name, slug, SDK version, etc.

#### `babel.config.js`
- Babel configuration file.
- Used for transpiling JavaScript code.

#### `package.json`
- Lists the dependencies of the project and includes scripts for running and building the app.
- Contains metadata about the project, such as name, version, and author.

#### `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`
- These files lock the dependencies versions for consistent installs.
- `yarn.lock` is used if you manage your dependencies with yarn.
- `package-lock.json` is used if you manage your dependencies with npm.

This is the basic structure you'll get when you initialize a new Expo project. You can further customize and organize your project by adding more directories and files as needed.
